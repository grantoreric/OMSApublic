As part of the Data Visualization and Analytics course for Georgia Tech's Online Masters in Analytics,
I participated in a team activity where we sought to match variables in Airbnb listings
and variables in nearby restaurants (from a Yelp! dataset)
to see what effects we could surmise that they had on one another. 
We localized this effort to Nashville, TN. 

The results were mixedâ€”but we could see a relationship between low vacancy (high booking percentage)
and popular and well-rated nearby restaurants.
